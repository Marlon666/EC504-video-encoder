##GUI
To run the Graphical User Interface prototype for our mid project report simply run the gui.py script. The ‘tkinter’ library may need to be installed by running

‘pip install tkinter’

As of now the Progress Bar moves 25% every time you click on “Encode Photos” for demonstration purposes. 

The ‘Disk Space vs. Quality’ slider will move when clicked and dragged by the user.

Clicking ‘Add Files’ will open a dialogue box where the user can select file(s) to be encoded. The ‘Remove File’ button will remove the file currently selected in the files list box.

To reorder files, the user can simply drag a file in the files list box to its desired position.
