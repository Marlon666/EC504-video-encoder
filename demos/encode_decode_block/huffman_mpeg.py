Special codes

These codes are used to delineate certain sections of an encoded bitstream. They are guaranteed to not collide with
image data. Why do we know this? The longest possible sequence of zeros in a standard MPEG huffman code is 11.
The longest possible sequence of zeros in a nonstandard MPEG huffman code is an escaped encoding of a (run, level) =
(0, 0), which equates to a string of 22 zeros, which could be followed by up to 11 zeros (for a total of 33 zeros).

Special codes are formed using 4.5 bytes of zeros, followed by 4 bits with a unique value. In actuality, we could be
a little tighter with bit usage, but with negligible benefit.
